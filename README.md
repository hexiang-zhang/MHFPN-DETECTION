# MHFPN-for-BREAST-MASS-DETECTION
The entire code is written based on mmdetection, so the basic environment of mmdetection needs to be built first.


1: Copy the file to the .../mmdetection/mmdet/models/necks/

2: Register the MHFPN module name in the .../mmdetection/mmdet/models/necks/__init__.py

3：Reinstall mmdet

4：Modify the name of the FPN module (ie MHFPN) in the config file.
